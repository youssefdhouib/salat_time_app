## Description

I developed a Prayer Times Application utilizing React.js and Material-UI, focusing on responsive design to ensure seamless functionality on small screens. By integrating APIs, users could select their city, and the application dynamically fetched and displayed accurate prayer times accordingly. This approach enhanced user experience, providing convenience and reliability for those seeking prayer timings.
